# 2D-Transient-Heat-Conduction-with-Non-Uniform-Generation-and-Radiative-Convective-Losses
Simulated unsteady 2D heat conduction in a diamond plate using an implicit finite difference method and Gauss–Seidel iteration. Modeled radiative–convective surface exchange using emissivity fits and Nusselt correlations, with MATLAB-based contour plots, flux graphs, and spectral radiance visualizations.
